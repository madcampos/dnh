												A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The
												flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action
												or if you cast it again.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you
												can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes
												<var>1d8</var> fire damage.
											</p>

												This spell's damage increases by <var>1d8</var> when you reach 5th level (<var>2d8</var>), 11th level (<var>3d8</var>), and 17th

												For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the
												spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an
												Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.
											</p>
											<p>
												You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift
												your attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the
												target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and
												something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either
												way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the
												creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the
												spell ends.
											</p>
											<p>
												Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly
												effective as part of an interrogation.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action
												during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2
												inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or
												lower or one that doesn't speak any language.
											</p>
											<p>
												Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above,
												even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

											<p>
												You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes
												anything that would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as
												such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the <var>alarm</var> spell, a <var>glyph of warding</var>, or a
												mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
											</p>
											<p>
												This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of
												the danger posed by a trap you sense.

											<p>
												Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your
												actions, shifting position so it's impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory
												duplicates.
											</p>
											<p>
												Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a <var>d20</var> to determine whether the attack
												instead targets one of your duplicates.
											</p>
											<p>
												If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you
												must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
											</p>
											<p>
												A duplicate's AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be
												destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are
												destroyed.
											</p>
											<p>
												A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can
												perceive illusions as false, as with <var>truesight</var>.

												You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When
												you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>
													Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability
													score.
												</li>
												<li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
												<li>
													While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action
													that turn doing nothing.
												</li>
												<li>While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra <var>1d8</var> necrotic damage to the target.</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												A <var>remove curse</var> spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be
												no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.

												You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration.
												The spell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected.
											</p>
											<p>
												While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of
												another creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
												saving throws. The target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though
												they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when
												<var>stunned</var> or otherwise <var>incapacitated</var>.
											</p>
											<p>
												While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be
												dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast spells.

											<p>
												This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting either
												immediate or long-term benefits.
											</p>
											<p>
												If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point
												become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.
											</p>
											<p>You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.</p>
											<p>
												If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become
												enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

												You can also turn <var>difficult terrain</var> caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that
												lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into <var>difficult terrain</var> that lasts for
												the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
											</p>
											<p>
												Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot
												themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

											<p>
												If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability
												to influence it.

												look in every direction.
											</p>
											<p>
												As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but
												it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as

											<p>
												You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for
												what appears:
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
												<li>Two fey creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower</li>
												<li>Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower</li>
												<li>Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
											</ul>
											<p>A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
											<p>
												The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have
												their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands
												to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
											</p>
											<p>The DM has the creatures' statistics.</p>

											<p>
												Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the
												ground in the area into <var>difficult terrain</var>.
											</p>
											<p>
												When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a
												Dexterity saving throw or take <var>3d6</var> bludgeoning damage and be <var>restrained</var> by the tentacles until the spell ends.
												A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already <var>restrained</var> by the tentacles takes <var>3d6</var> bludgeoning
												damage.
											</p>
											<p>
												A creature <var>restrained</var> by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your
												spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

												it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface
												or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond
												that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage
												carries over to its original object form.
											</p>
											<p>
												If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack
												with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
												piercing damage based on its form.

												Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that
												lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the
												DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
											</p>
											<p>
												If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25% chance for each casting
												after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

											<p>
												You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods,
												rope, wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object
												created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before.
											</p>
											<p>
												The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

											<p>
												You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are
												fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes <var>charmed</var>
												by you for the duration. The <var>charmed</var> target is <var>incapacitated</var> and unaware of its surroundings, though it can
												still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are
												modified.
											</p>
											<p>
												While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted
												no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect
												clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
											</p>
											<p>
												You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the
												modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have
												finished describing the modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the
												spell ends.
											</p>
											<p>
												A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural
												inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed
												dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a
												creature in a significant manner.
											</p>
											<p>
												A <var>remove curse</var> or <var>greater restoration</var> spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

												This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you
												choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by
												this spell.
											</p>
											<p>
												The spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot
												shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the
												same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you
												use your action to dismiss it sooner.
											</p>
											<p>
												The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a
												creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and
												hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you
												while it was seemingly still in midair.
											</p>
											<p>
												A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (<var>Investigation</var>) check against your spell save
												DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

												An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you
												choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it
												into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten
												10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for
												the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your
												choice which side).
											</p>
											<p>
												Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <var>dispel magic</var>. A <var
												>disintegrate</var> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal

												spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't
												come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two
												spells. For example, a contingency cast with <var>water breathing</var> might stipulate that
												<var>water breathing</var> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.
											</p>
											<p>
												The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and
												then contingency ends.
											</p>
											<p>
												The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a
												time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its
												material component is ever not on your person.

												You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must
												make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is <var>restrained</var> as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save,
												the creature isn't affected.
											</p>
											<p>
												A creature <var>restrained</var> by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
												successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and
												subjected to the <var>petrified</var> condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep
												track of both until the target collects three of a kind.
											</p>
											<p>
												If the creature is physically broken while <var>petrified</var>, it suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original
												state.
											</p>
											<p>
												If you maintain your <var>concentration</var> on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until
												the effect is removed.

												Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters the container you used for the spell's material component.
												While your soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the container's space. You can't move
												or use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your
												living body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid's body.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a <var>protection from evil and
													good</var> or <var>magic circle</var> spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure,
												your soul moves into the target's body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target resists
												your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
											</p>
											<p>
												Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you
												retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain the benefit of your own class features. If the
												target has any class levels, you can't use any of its class features.
											</p>
											<p>
												Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at
												all.
											</p>
											<p>
												While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you,
												returning the host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in it, the creature dies, and you must make a
												Charisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.
												Otherwise, you die.
											</p>
											<p>
												If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away
												from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If another creature's soul is in the container when it
												is destroyed, the creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
											</p>
											<p>When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.</p>

												of cosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an
												unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request
												that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).
											</p>
											<p>
												When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service
												in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help
												us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate
												with the creature to bargain for its services.
											</p>
											<p>
												Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while
												a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by
												you.
											</p>
											<p>
												As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours
												requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments
												based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be
												halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might
												require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
											</p>
											<p>
												After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane
												after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's
												service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.
											</p>
											<p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p>

												You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud.
												While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only
												actions a creature can take in this form are the <var>Dash</var> action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute,
												during which time a creature is <var>incapacitated</var> and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form,
												which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
											</p>
											<p>
												If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands,
												which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

												An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs into existence around an area you choose within range.
												The prison can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.
											</p>
											<p>A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.</p>
											<p>
												A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing
												through it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
											</p>
											<p>
												When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the
												area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the
												area.
											</p>
											<p>
												A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to
												leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a
												failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane,
												blocking ethereal travel.

												When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or
												within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface,
												the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in
												its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without
												being triggered.
											</p>
											<p>
												The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (<var>Investigation</var>) check against your spell save DC to find it.
											</p>
											<p>
												You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include
												touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating
												the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within
												a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical
												characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers).
												You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.
											</p>
											<p>
												When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
												60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph
												activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

											<summary>Spell description<span class="visually-hidden"> for "Antimagic Field"</span></summary>
											<p>
												A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the
												multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the
												spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.
											</p>
											<p>
												Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude
												into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it
												spends suppressed counts against its duration.
											</p>
											<details>
												<summary>Targeted Effects</summary>
												<p>
													Spells and other magical effects, such as <var>magic missile</var> and <var>charm person</var>, that target a creature or an
													object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Areas of Magic</summary>
												<p>
													The area of another spell or magical effect, such as <var>fireball</var>, can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps
													an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of
													fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Spells</summary>
												<p>
													Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is
													in it.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Magic Items</summary>
												<p>
													The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a
													nonmagical longsword.
												</p>
												<p>
													A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in
													the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or
													throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Magical Travel</summary>
												<p>
													Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for
													such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional
													space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Creatures and Objects</summary>
												<p>
													A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
													reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Dispel Magic</summary>
												<p>
													Spells and magical effects such as <var>dispel magic</var> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by
													different <var>antimagic field</var> spells don't nullify each other.
												</p>

											<p>
												You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
												<var>charmed</var> by you for the duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the
												saving throw.
											</p>
											<p>
												While the creature is <var>charmed</var>, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of
												existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it
												does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or
												"Fetch that object." If the creature completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves
												itself to the best of its ability.
											</p>
											<p>
												You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only
												the actions you choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to
												use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.
											</p>
											<p>
												Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell
												ends.

											<p>
												You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence.
												The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you
												choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
											</p>
											<p>
												The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its
												front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
											</p>
											<p>
												Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their
												domains.
											</p>
											<p>
												When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that
												creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the
												creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it
												is free to act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

												point you choose within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes through a
												space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
											</p>
											<p>
												The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at
												the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves
												to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become
												<var>blinded</var> for 1 minute.
											</p>
											<p>
												The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it
												does so one layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a
												Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.
											</p>
											<p>
												The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is
												destroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. An <var>antimagic field</var> has no effect on a prismatic wall.
											</p>
											<details>
												<summary>Red</summary>
												<p>
													The creature takes <var>10d6</var> fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is
													in place, nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage
													to it.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Orange</summary>
												<p>
													The creature takes <var>10d6</var> acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is
													in place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Yellow</summary>
												<p>
													The creature takes <var>10d6</var> lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can
													be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Green</summary>
												<p>
													The creature takes <var>10d6</var> poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
													<var>passwall</var> spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this
													layer.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Blue</summary>
												<p>
													The creature takes <var>10d6</var> cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be
													destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Indigo</summary>
												<p>
													On a failed save, the creature is <var>restrained</var>. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
													turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and
													is subjected to the <var>petrified</var> condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both
													until the creature collects three of a kind.
												</p>
												<p>
													While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a
													<var>daylight</var> spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.
												</p>
											</details>
											<details>
												<summary>Violet</summary>
												<p>
													On a failed save, the creature is <var>blinded</var>. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A
													successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and
													is no longer <var>blinded</var>. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while
													other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a <var>dispel magic</var> spell
													or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.
