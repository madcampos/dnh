								<summary>Trance</summary>
								<p>
									Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is
									"trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years
									of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Note:</strong> If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long
									rest; only the duration is changed.

							<details>
								<summary>Languages</summary>
								<p>
									You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and
									varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their
									repertoires.
