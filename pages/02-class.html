								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>
									<p>
										The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
										you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number
										of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have
										spell slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared
										spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <var>cure wounds</var>, you can
										cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in
										prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your

									You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
									you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
									revert if you fall <var>unconscious</var>, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
								</p>
								<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
										Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
										creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If
										the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
									</li>
									<li>
										When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
										points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
										your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
										the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked <var>unconscious</var>.
									</li>
									<li>
										You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
										Transforming doesn't break your <var>concentration</var> on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
										are part of a spell, such as <var>call lightning</var>, that you've already cast.
									</li>
									<li>
										You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of
										doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as <var>darkvision</var>, unless your new form also has that sense.
									</li>
									<li>
										You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions
										as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
										Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the
										ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If thecreature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature&apos;s bonus instead of yours. Ifthe creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&apos;t use them.</li><li>When you transform, you assume the beast&apos;s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hitpoints you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over toyour normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long asthe excess damage doesn&apos;t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren&apos;t knocked <var>unconscious</var>.</li><li>You can&apos;t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.Transforming doesn&apos;t break your <var>concentration</var> on a spell you&apos;ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions thatare part of a spell, such as <var>call lightning</var>, that you&apos;ve already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable ofdoing so. However, you can&apos;t use any of your special senses, such as <var>darkvision</var>, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functionsas normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature&apos;s shape and size.Your equipment doesn&apos;t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can&apos;t wear must either fall to theground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul>"}'

									Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortsword and any simple

								<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
									<li>
										You can roll a <var>d4</var> in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,

									<li>
										When you use the <var>Attack</var> action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus

										action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

									<p>
										You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a

										of a level for which you have spell slots.

										For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of

									<p>
										A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves

										or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of

										self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
									</p>
									<p>
										If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's
										discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option
										that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

										For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <var>witch bolt</var>, you must spend

								<summary>Spellcasting</summary>
								<p>
									As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the
									general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
								</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Cantrips</summary>
									<p>
										At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
										higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellbook</summary>
									<p>
										At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
										spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>
									<p>
										The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
										must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
										equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
										slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
										prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
										spell <var>magic missile</var>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of
										prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying
										your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
										spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and
										memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
										modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Ritual Casting</summary>
									<p>
										You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have
										the spell prepared.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Focus</summary>
									<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</summary>
									<p>
										Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level
										for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
										spellbook (see "Your Spellbook").
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Your Spellbook</summary>
									<p>
										The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
										breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a
										spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
									</p>
									<p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p>

									<details>
										<summary>Copying a Spell into the Book</summary>
										<p>
											When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if
											you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
										</p>
										<p>
											Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation
											used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it
											into your spellbook using your own notation.
										</p>
										<p>
											For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
											experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can
											prepare the spell just like your other spells.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>Copying from a Spell Scroll</summary>
										<p>
											A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll,
											you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
											successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>Replacing the Book</summary>
										<p>
											You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
											just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
											cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling
											out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup
											spellbooks in a safe place.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>The Book's Appearance</summary>
										<p>
											Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional
											leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
											loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
