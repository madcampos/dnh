							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-barbarian-rage">
								<summary>Rage</summary>
								<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>
								<p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
									<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. This bonus increases as you level.</li>
									<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>
								<p>
									Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked <var>unconscious</var> or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile
									creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once you have raged the maximum number of times for your barbarian level, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. You may rage 2
									times at 1st level, 3 at 3rd, 4 at 6th, 5 at 12th, and 6 at 17th.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-barbarian-unarmored-defense">
								<summary>Unarmored Defense</summary>
								<p>
									While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and
									still gain this benefit.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-barbarian-danger-sense">
								<summary>Danger Sense</summary>
								<p>
									At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You
									have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be <var
									>blinded</var>, <var>deafened</var>, or <var>incapacitated</var>.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-barbarian-reckless-attack">
								<summary>Reckless Attack</summary>
								<p>
									Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your
									turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
									rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-barbarian-primal-knowledge">
								<summary>Primal Knowledge</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 3rd level and again at 10th level, you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the list of skills available to
									barbarians at 1st level.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-barbarian-primal-path">
								<summary>Primal Path</summary>
								<p>
									At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage from the list of available paths. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
									level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="4" id="class-feature-barbarian-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
									normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
								</p>
								<p>If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="5" id="class-feature-barbarian-extra-attack">
								<summary>Extra Attack</summary>
								<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the <var>Attack</var> action on your turn.</p>

							<details data-level="7" id="class-feature-barbarian-feral-instinct">
								<summary>Feral Instinct</summary>
								<p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, if you are <var>surprised</var> at the beginning of combat and aren't <var>incapacitated</var>, you can act normally on your first
									turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="7" id="class-feature-barbarian-instinctive-pounce">
								<summary>Instinctive Pounce</summary>

								<summary>Relentless Rage</summary>

									Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die
									outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.
								</p>
								<p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>

								<summary>Bardic Inspiration</summary>
								<p>
									You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself
									within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a <var>d6</var>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
									makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the <var>d20</var> before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before
									the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
									Inspiration die at a time.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a
									long rest.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a <var>d8</var> at 5th level, a <var>d10</var>
									at 10th level, and a <var>d12</var> at 15th level.

									You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast

									<summary>Cantrips</summary>
									<p>
										You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning
										a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level.
									</p>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Spell Slots</summary>
									<p>
										The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
										expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <var>cure wounds</var> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
										<var>cure wounds</var> using either slot.
									</p>
								</details>

										for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
										bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
									</p>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your
										music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
										when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

								<summary>Divine Domain</summary>
								<p>
									Choose one domain related to your deity from the list of available domains. Each domain is detailed in their own feature, and each one provides
									examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you
									additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
								</p>
								<details>
									<summary>Domain Spells</summary>
									<p>
										Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a
										domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
									</p>
									<p>If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>
								</details>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-cleric-spellcasting">
								<summary>Spellcasting</summary>
								<p>
									As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for a selection
									of cleric spells.
								</p>
								<details>
									<summary>Cantrips</summary>
									<p>
										"At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at
										higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.
									</p>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>
									<p>
										The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
										must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a
										number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
										you have spell slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
										prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <var>cure wounds</var>,
										you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer
										and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your
										Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
										DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
									</p>
								</details>

									<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

								<summary>Channel Divinity</summary>
								<p>
									At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with
									two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as
									noted in the domain description.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
									again.
								</p>
								<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>
								<p>
									Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between
									rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

							</details>
							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-cleric-channel-divinity:-harness-divine-power">
								<summary>Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power</summary>
								<p>
									You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one
									expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this
									feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended
									uses when you finish a long rest.

							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-cleric-channel-divinity:-turn-undead">
								<summary>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</summary>
								<p>
									As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
									must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
								</p>
								<p>
									A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
									you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the <var>Dash</var> action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
									from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the <var>Dodge</var> action.

									You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this
									language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't

								<summary>Spellcasting</summary>
								<p>
									Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
									spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.
								</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Cantrips</summary>
									<p>
										At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher
										levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>
									<p>
										The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
										you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number
										of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have
										spell slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared
										spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <var>cure wounds</var>, you can
										cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in
										prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
										Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for
										a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
									</p>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Ritual Casting</summary>
									<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

									You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the
									<var>find familiar</var> spell, without material components.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half
									your druid level.
								</p>

									Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
									twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform

								</div>
								<p>
									You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
									you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
									revert if you fall <var>unconscious</var>, drop to 0 hit points, or die.
								</p>
								<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
										Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
										creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If
										the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
									</li>
									<li>
										When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
										points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
										your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as
										the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked <var>unconscious</var>.
									</li>
									<li>
										You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
										Transforming doesn't break your <var>concentration</var> on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that
										are part of a spell, such as <var>call lightning</var>, that you've already cast.
									</li>
									<li>
										You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of
										doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as <var>darkvision</var>, unless your new form also has that sense.
									</li>
									<li>
										You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions
										as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
										Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the
										ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

								<summary>Martial Arts</summary>
								<p>
									Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortsword and any simple
									melee weapons that don't have the two-handed or heavy property.
								</p>
								<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
									<li>
										You can roll a <var>d4</var> in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,
										as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
									</li>
									<li>
										When you use the <var>Attack</var> action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
										action. For example, if you take the <var>Attack</var> action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus
										action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
									short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).
								</p>

								<summary>Dedicated Weapon</summary>
								<p>
									You train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or
									long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.
								</p>
								<p>The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.</li>
									<li>You must be proficient with it.</li>
									<li>It must lack the heavy and special properties.</li>

							</details>
							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-monk-ki">
								<summary>Ki</summary>
								<p>
									Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki
									points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the
									Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
									into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
									follows:

									Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the
									damage you take from the attack is reduced by <var>1d10</var> + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
									If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack (range 20/60 feet) with the weapon or piece of ammunition
									you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile

								<p>
									The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
									action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or

									sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
									place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the <var>hallow</var> spell.
								</p>
								<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-paladin-lay-on-hands">

									Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore

								</p>
								<p>
									As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount
									remaining in your pool.
								</p>
								<p>
									Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.
									You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

								<p>
									By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See chapter 10 for the
									general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the paladin spell list.
								</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>

									<p>
										The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or
										higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
										number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
										of a level for which you have spell slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of
										prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd-level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <var>cure wounds</var>,
										you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in
										prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
										Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC
										for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
									</p>

							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-paladin-channel-divinity">
								<summary>Channel Divinity</summary>
								<p>
									Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use
									it.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
									again.
								</p>
								<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-paladin-channel-divinity:-harness-divine-power">
								<summary>Channel Divinity: Harness Divine Power</summary>
								<p>
									You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one
									expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this
									feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 3rd level, once; 7th level, twice; and 15th level, thrice. You regain all expended

							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-paladin-sacred-oath">
								<summary>Sacred Oath</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage,
									committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose from the list of available oaths.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity
									feature.
								</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Oath Spells</summary>
									<p>
										Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
										access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
									</p>
									<p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Breaking Your Oath</summary>
									<p>
										A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves
										too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his
										or her oath.", "A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin
										of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of
										self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
									</p>
									<p>
										If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM's
										discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option
										that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

								<details>
									<summary>Spell Slots</summary>
									<p>
										The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
										must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <var>animal friendship</var> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can

										"Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom

								<summary>Expertise</summary>
								<p>
									At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your
									proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
								</p>
								<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-rogue-sneak-attack">
								<summary>Sneak Attack</summary>
								<p>
									Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra <var>1d6</var>
									damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
								</p>
								<p>
									You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't <var>incapacitated</var>,
									and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
								</p>
								<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-rogue-thieves'-cant">
								<summary>Thieves' Cant</summary>
								<p>
									During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
									normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a
									message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the
									territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves
									on the run.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="2" id="class-feature-rogue-cunning-action">
								<summary>Cunning Action</summary>
								<p>
									Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in
									combat. This action can be used only to take the <var>Dash</var>, <var>Disengage</var>, or <var>Hide</var> action.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-rogue-roguish-archetype">
								<summary>Roguish Archetype</summary>
								<p>
									At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your
									archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="3" id="class-feature-rogue-steady-aim">
								<summary>Steady Aim</summary>
								<p>
									As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't
									moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="4" id="class-feature-rogue-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As
									normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
								</p>
								<p>If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="5" id="class-feature-rogue-uncanny-dodge">
								<summary>Uncanny Dodge</summary>
								<p>
									Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against
									you.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="6" id="class-feature-rogue-expertise">
								<summary>Expertise</summary>
								<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain the benefit of Expertise.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="7" id="class-feature-rogue-evasion">
								<summary>Evasion</summary>
								<p>
									Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an <var>ice
										storm</var> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you
									instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="8" id="class-feature-rogue-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>
								<p>

							</details>
							<details data-level="11" id="class-feature-rogue-reliable-talent">
								<summary>Reliable Talent</summary>
								<p>
									By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
									proficiency bonus, you can treat a <var>d20</var> roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="12" id="class-feature-rogue-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>

									Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or <var>invisible</var> creature within 10 feet of
									you.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="15" id="class-feature-rogue-slippery-mind">
								<summary>Slippery Mind</summary>
								<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="16" id="class-feature-rogue-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

								<p>At 17th level, you gain a feature granted by your Roguish Archetype.</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="18" id="class-feature-rogue-elusive">
								<summary>Elusive</summary>
								<p>
									Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you
									while you aren't <var>incapacitated</var>.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="19" id="class-feature-rogue-ability-score-improvement">
								<summary>Ability Score Improvement</summary>
								<p>
									When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.

								<summary>Stroke of Luck</summary>
								<p>
									At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
									into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the <var>d20</var> roll as a 20.
								</p>
								<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

									In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical
									ability.
								</p>
								<p>
									At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. A list of the available options can be found on the Optional Features page. When
									you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that
									you could learn at that level.
								</p>
								<p>
									If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its
									prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

								<summary>Arcane Recovery</summary>
								<p>
									You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose
									expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),
									and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot
									or two 1st-level spell slots.
								</p>
							</details>
							<details data-level="1" id="class-feature-wizard-spellcasting">
								<summary>Spellcasting</summary>
								<p>
									As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the
									general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
								</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Cantrips</summary>
									<p>
										At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
										higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellbook</summary>
									<p>
										At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
										spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Preparing and Casting Spells</summary>
									<p>
										The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
										must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
									</p>
									<p>
										You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
										equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
										slots.
									</p>
									<p>
										For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
										prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
										spell <var>magic missile</var>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of
										prepared spells.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying
										your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
										spell on your list.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Ability</summary>
									<p>
										Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and
										memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
										modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Ritual Casting</summary>
									<p>
										You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have
										the spell prepared.
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Spellcasting Focus</summary>
									<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</summary>
									<p>
										Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level
										for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
										spellbook (see "Your Spellbook").
									</p>
								</details>

								<details>
									<summary>Your Spellbook</summary>
									<p>
										The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
										breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a
										spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
									</p>
									<p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p>

									<details>
										<summary>Copying a Spell into the Book</summary>
										<p>
											When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if
											you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
										</p>
										<p>
											Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation
											used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it
											into your spellbook using your own notation.
										</p>
										<p>
											For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
											experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can
											prepare the spell just like your other spells.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>Copying from a Spell Scroll</summary>
										<p>
											A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll,
											you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
											successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>Replacing the Book</summary>
										<p>
											You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
											just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
											cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling
											out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup
											spellbooks in a safe place.
										</p>
									</details>

									<details>
										<summary>The Book's Appearance</summary>
										<p>
											Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional
											leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
											loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

									You have scribed a set of arcane formulas in your spellbook that you can use to formulate a cantrip in your mind. Whenever you finish a long
