# Dungeons & HTML

This is a small demo of how much can be done with native HTML forms. Those get progressively enhanced with CSS and then JS.

The basic HTML version works and depends on a server to interpret all data, but it provides basic validation to the user. With added CSS, there are more things that can be done, like showing places that need interaction and hiding extra content.

Lastly, with JS, the form saves state locally and navigate in a more seamless manner.
