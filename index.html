								<p>
									Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is
									"trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years
									of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
								</p>

									<strong>Note:</strong> If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long
									rest; only the duration is changed.

									You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They
									write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak
									Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

									You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal
									with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical
									expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
